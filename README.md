# Project Title: Weather-Based Play Prediction using Machine Learning

# Project Description:

The Weather-Based Play Prediction project is a machine learning initiative designed to predict whether outdoor activities or sports events should take place based on weather forecasts. This project leverages a weather dataset containing relevant meteorological features to train a machine learning model that can assist event organizers, sports teams, or individuals in making informed decisions about scheduling activities.

# Key Features:

1. Dataset Selection: Utilize a weather forecast dataset containing features such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and humidity. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the machine learning model.

2. Binary Classification Model: Employ a binary classification machine learning model, such as logistic regression or a decision tree classifier, to predict whether outdoor activities should take place. The model will be trained on historical weather data and corresponding play decisions.

3. Feature Engineering: Explore and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and convert categorical variables. Feature engineering ensures that the data is appropriately prepared for machine learning model training.

4. Model Training and Evaluation: Train the machine learning model on a subset of the dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step ensures the model's reliability in predicting play decisions based on weather conditions.

5. Prediction Interface: Create a user-friendly interface or API that allows users to input future weather forecast data and receive predictions on whether outdoor activities are recommended.

6. Model Interpretability: Provide insights into the decision-making process of the machine learning model by examining feature importance. This analysis helps users understand which weather variables have the most significant impact on play predictions.

# Dependencies:

The project relies on popular Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning implementation, and Flask for creating a simple prediction interface.
